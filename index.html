The hitchhikers guide to the galaxy</a> by douglas adams . In the fiction novel the earth was constructed as an experiment by the deep thought computer and rats who have been stated as pan dimentional beings took the role of lab rats to monitor the progress.
 many physicists have been inspired by this idea and are discussing the possibiity of our lives being a simulation</p>
<p> <h2 align=center> Points in Favour and Against</h2></p><br><p> <h4><b>In favour</b></h4>
<ul type= disc><li><b> religeous beliefs</b>- many religions have the place of a supreme being not from our planet these ideas have been widely accepted for many millenia . Many religions also have spoken about the presence of a soul . It have been claimed that the soul is a non physical entity or a force which resides in the body made of physical elements. upon death it leaves the
body to return the the planet after aquiring a new body this can be compaired with games which are a simulation of the real world .</li>

</ul> </p><br>
<p> <b> against the argument</b><ul type=disc><li><b>computational results</b>- In October 2017, a team of mathematicians and physicists published a research paper that takes an admirably straightforward and two-fisted approach to the question. They decided to get to the bottom of things by using some very powerful computers to crunch some heavy-duty numbers.
The conclusion: Based on everything we now know about physics and computers, it is mathematically impossible for the known universe to be a computer simulation.their paper-<a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/9/e1701758">simulation theory disproved</a></li><li><b>Absence of concrete proof</b>- no result has either been able to fully accept or deny this hypothesis . Thus no conclusions can be made right now . as no scientific theory is considered true untill there is presence of a good 
amount of proof thus by defaut this can be considered untrue
</li><li><b>hossenfelder's argument - </b>" Indeed, there are good reasons to believe it's not possible. The idea that our universe is discretized clashes with observations because it runs into conflict with special relativity. The effects of violating the symmetries of special relativity aren't necessarily small and have been looked for â€” and nothing's been found." </li>
<li><b> absence of our ability to distinguish between a simulated world or the real world </b>- This fact has been debated by many scientists that we donot have the ability to consclusively check this statement and thus for us living in a simuated world or a non simulated world makes no difference an stimulatedworld is as good as a nonstimulated world.</li></ul></p>
